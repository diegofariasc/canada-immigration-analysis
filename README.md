# Immigration Integration Narrative Visualization

This project presents an interactive narrative visualization that explores the tough integration journey of immigrants in Canada. The visualization employs a structured, author-driven slideshow format composed of four sequential scenes, guiding users through key aspects of immigrant experiences from arrival to long-term integration challenges.

## Technologies

- **JavaScript** for interactive logic and state management.
- **D3.js, topo-json and D3-annotation** for data-driven document manipulation and chart rendering.
- **HTML5 & CSS** for structure and styling.

## Narrative Structure
The visualization follows an interactive slideshow design, where users navigate through four scenes using "Previous" and "Next" buttons. This structure provides a clear, logical progression that reflects typical newcomer needs: initial arrival and settlement patterns, housing affordability, employment challenges, and access to healthcare.

Each scene encourages user exploration through interactive elements such as hover tooltips, clickable bars, and toggles.

## Visual and Interaction Design

- **Consistent Layout:** Each scene includes a title, descriptive paragraph, interactive charts, key takeaway footer, data source citations, and navigation controls.

- **Color and Typography:** A consistent color palette assigns distinct colors to provinces, maintained throughout the visualization for easy cross-scene reference.

- **Responsiveness:** The visualization dynamically adapts to various screen sizes.

- **Transitions and Animations:** Smooth scene transitions and subtle chart animations guide attention and support the narrative flow.

- **Highlighting:** Important data points are emphasized through bold text, distinct colors, and annotations to direct focus to critical insights.

## Scenes Overview

1. **Growing Immigration in Canada:** Shows the steady increase of immigrants since 1991 via a bar chart and a dynamic pie chart illustrating immigrant distribution across provinces.

2. **Finding Home, Facing Prices:** Compares housing price trends across provinces, emphasizing affordability challenges in high-immigration provinces.

3. **Canadaâ€™s Newcomer Job Puzzle:** Highlights employment integration challenges through a scatterplot of immigrant populations versus provincial unemployment rates, with annotations explaining systemic barriers.

4. **Newcomers in Search of Care:** Presents a choropleth map detailing unmet healthcare needs among immigrants, underscoring ongoing access issues in major settlement provinces.
